ChatApp

This ChatApp was developed as part of my learning journey into WebSockets and real-time web communication.

The primary goal of this project was to understand how WebSockets work under the hood and how they enable bi-directional communication between the client and the server without the need for constant polling.

📚 What I Learned

*Establishing and managing WebSocket connections.
